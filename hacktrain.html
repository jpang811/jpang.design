            <h3 class="section-heading">The Ride Begins</h3>
            <p>I had no idea what to expect for my first hackathon except a sleepness night and abundant adrenaline rush. I was right but it was so rewarding.</p>
            <p>The hackathon was co-hosted by Hack Partners and MTR.  The main objective was clearly laid out: to solve two main challenges: <span class="keywords">Customer Experience (CX)</span> and <span class="keywords">Operations Efficiency</span>. Traveling all over Hong Kong by train, we covered MTR facilities, co-working spaces and even hacked overnight at a top tourist hot spot. It was both physical and mental endurance.</p>
           
            <h3 class="section-heading">The Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>As daily commuters (users) of the Hong Kong railway, better known as MTR, I can relate to so many pain points but many of which I initially thought can only be solved with infrastructure.</p>
            <p>This is my current state.</p>
            <div class="pfolio-img">
                <img src="img/portfolio/hacktrain/journey.jpg" class="img-responsive">
            </div>
            <p>And I think to myself:</p>
            <div class="pfolio-img">
                <img src="img/portfolio/hacktrain/exptrain.jpg" class="img-responsive">
            </div>
            <p>I think about the “Express Train” solution all the time.  But I realized that’s an infrastructure issue that I cannot possibly propose as a tech solution at the hackathon.</p>
            <p>So I thought about my personal experience, particularly my own emotions on the train. MTR achieves over 80% utilization rate during peak hours but the crowd density and congestion are still the main problem statements, whether it’s from a CX or Operations perspective.</p>
            <div class="pfolio-img">
                <p>+Emotions mapped out</p>
                <img src="img/portfolio/hacktrain/journey-emotions.jpg" class="img-responsive">
            </div>

            <h3 class="section-heading">Efficiency vs Optimization</h3>
            <p>MTR is hands-down one of the best subway system in the world.  It is highly efficient and reliable but the problem is it is not <i>optimized</i>. And that’s a very clear distinction.</p>
            <p>The high frequency of train answers to high traffic and dense crowds.  But the congestion from exiting platforms and stations during peak hours are not optimized.</p>
            
            <p>I decided to tackle optimization, which I like to refer as enhancement from the CX perspective. In other words, <span class="keywords">how do I enhance a commuter’s journey?</span> And that’s exactly how I crafted the story for my pitch.</p>
                    
            <h3 class="section-heading">Starting with the Morning Commute</h3>
            <p>Focusing on the morning commute peak hours, I wanted to improve the users' everyday emotions going in to work, like the hunger state for example.  I can't help users' discomfort when traveling on a packed train, but at the very least, I can help users control their journey and start their day right - <span class="keywords">ordering breakfast on-the-go.</span></p>
            <p>I proposed this as my first pitch which is how and where we form our teams of 4. I called the idea Champs because "Breakfast are for champions".</p>

            <p>It sold and aligned very well with my newfound team mates and we got to hacking right away that first night.<br>
            <span class="remarks-i">(Left to right: Me, Anthony the Developer, KK the Developer, Zoe the Entrepreneur).</span></p>

            <h3 class="section-heading">Breakfast Implications</h3>
            <p>It was Day 2. After Q&A and a series of Instagram-worthy photoshoots at MTR's behind-the-scenes operations center, we spent majority  of the day brainstorming, building, developing and being mentored at a co-working space.</p>

            <p>As we were hashing out our user flow, product features and business model, we realized that it relies on quite a number of dependencies - namely the tenant's operations, software and hardware integration, and also customer journey. We were challenged by various mentors all of which represent a different stakeholder point of view and priorities.</p>
            <p>We analyzed every stakeholder needs in detail and pivoted back and forth.  At one point, we suggested a centralized food pop-up store for users to pick up their breakfast and at another, we went off tangent to a sharing economy concept alike for tenants. Then we realized, we were no longer solving user needs anymore.</p>
            <p>We reverted to our original idea and focused on enriching it. Luckily, our developers were already building the foundation and structure of our app all the while we were pivoting.</p>

This translates to <span class="keywords">reduced wait time, reduced congestion and a happier customer</span>.  The idea is to keep the commuters informed to make better decisions and ultimately be in control of their journey.</p>

            <p>48 hours of work and less than 10 hours of sleep later, our hard work paid off. Referred to as the "eBay equivalent mobile platform", we scored second place and earned ourselves a handy Samsung Tablet.</p>

            <p>I spent the next few days rejoicing my rewarding experience at this hackathon.</p>
