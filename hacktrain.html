            <h3 class="section-heading">The Ride Begins</h3>
            <p>I had no idea what to expect for my first hackathon except a sleepness night and abundant adrenaline rush. I was right but it was so rewarding.</p>
            <p>The hackathon was co-hosted by Hack Partners and MTR.  The main objective was clearly laid out: to solve two main challenges: <span class="keywords">Customer Experience (CX)</span> and <span class="keywords">Operations Efficiency</span>. Traveling all over Hong Kong by train, we covered MTR facilities, co-working spaces and even hacked overnight at the top tourist hot spot. It was both physical and mental endurance.</p>
            <div class="pfolio-img">
                <img src="img/portfolio/hacktrain/currentstate.jpg" class="img-responsive">
            </div>
            <h3 class="section-heading">The Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>As daily commuters (users) of the Hong Kong railway, better known as MTR, I can relate to so many pain points but many of which I initially thought can only be solved with infrastructure.</p>
            <p>This is my current state.</p>
            <div class="pfolio-img">
                <img src="img/portfolio/hacktrain/currentstate.jpg" class="img-responsive">
            </div>
            <p>I think about the “Express Train” solution all the time.  But I realized that’s an infrastructure issue that I cannot possibly propose as a tech solution at the hackathon.</p>
            <p>So I thought about my personal experience, particularly my own emotions on the train. In the context of Hong Kong’s subway system, namely MTR, achieves up to 90% utilization rate but the density and traffic are still the main problem statements, whether it’s from a CX or Operations perspective.</p>
            <div class="pfolio-img">
                <p>+Emotions mapped out</p>
                <img src="img/portfolio/hacktrain/currentstate.jpg" class="img-responsive">
            </div>

            <h3 class="section-heading">Efficiency vs Optimization</h3>
            <p>MTR is hands-down one of the best subway system in the world.  It is highly efficient and reliable but the problem is it is not <i>optimized</i>. And that’s a very clear distinction.</p>
            <p>The high frequency of train answers to high traffic and dense crowds.  But the congestion from exiting platforms stations particularly during peak hours are not optimized.</p>
            
            <p>I decided to tackle optimization, which I like to refer as enhancement from the CX perspective. In other words, I asked myself, <span class="keywords">how do I enhance a commuter’s journey?</span> And that’s exactly how I crafted the story for my pitch.</p>
                    
            <h3 class="section-heading">Starting with the Morning Commute</h3>
            <p>Focusing on the morning commute peak hour periods, I wanted to improve the users' everyday emotions going in to work, particularly the hunger state.  Even if I can't control the discomfort from traveling on a packed train, then at least I can help users control their journey and starting their day right - ordering breakfast on-the-go.</p>
            <p>I proposed this as my first pitch which is how and where we form teams of 4. I called the idea Champs because "breakfast are for champions".</p>

            <p>It sold and aligned very well with my newfound team mates and we got to hacking right away that first night.<br>

            <h3 class="section-heading">Breakfast Implications</h3>
            <p>After Q&A and a series of Instagram-worthy photoshoots at MTR's behind-the-scenes operations center, we spent majority  of the day brainstorming, building, developing and being mentored at a co-working space.</p>

            <p>As we were hashing out our user flow, product features and business model, we realized that it relies on quite a number of complexities - namely the tenant's operations, software and hardware integration, and also customer journey. We were challenged by various mentors all of which represent a different stakeholder point of view and therefore naturally very different priorities as a result.</p>
            <p>We analyzed every stakeholder needs in detail and pivoted back and forth.  At one point, we suggested a centralized food pop-up store for users to pick up their breakfast and then went off tangent to a sharing economy concept alike for tenants. And we realized, we were no longer solving user needs anymore.</p>
            <p>We went back to our original idea and focused on enriching it. Luckily, our developers were already coding away the fundamental structure of our app all the while we were pivoting ideas.</p>

            <p>MTR To-Go is a mobile e-commerce platform to order your breakfast goods on the train and made ready for pick-up right when you exit the station. This translates to reduced wait time, reduced congestion and a happier customer.  The idea is to keep the commuters informed to <span class="keywords">make better decisions and ultimately be in control of their journey.</span></p>
        
            <p>And in my case, that means catching my connecting bus because I didn’t have to wait in line for my breakfast.</p>

            <h3 class="section-heading">It's a Job Well Done</h3>
            <p>48 hours of work and less than 10 hours of shut eye sleep later, our hard work paid off. Referred to as the "eBay equivalent mobile platform", we scored second place and earned ourselves a handy Samsung Tablet!</p>

            <p>I spent the next few days rejoicing my rewarding experience at this hackathon.</p>

            <p>I loved the highs and lows and discovered that I fared well in this type of environment - Agile, Innovative and Collaborative.</p>
