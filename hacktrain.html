            <h3 class="section-heading">The Ride Begins</h3>
            <p>I had no idea what to expect for my first hackathon except a sleepness night and abundant adrenaline rush.</p>
            <p>The hackathon was co-hosted by Hack Partners and MTR.  The main objective was clearly laid out: to solve two main challenges: <span class="keywords">Customer Experience (CX)</span> and <span class="keywords">Operations Efficiency</span>. Traveling all over Hong Kong by train, we covered MTR facilities, co-working spaces and even hacked overnight at a top tourist hot spot. It was both physical and mental endurance.</p>
           
            <h3 class="section-heading">The Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>As daily commuters (users) of the Hong Kong railway, better known as MTR, I can relate to so many pain points but many of which I initially thought can only be solved with infrastructure.</p>
            <p>This is my current state.</p>
            <div class="pfolio-img" style="max-width: 100%;">
                <img src="img/portfolio/hacktrain/journey.jpg" class="img-responsive">
            </div>
            <p>And I think to myself:</p>
            <div class="pfolio-img" style="max-width: 100%;">
                <img src="img/portfolio/hacktrain/exptrain.jpg" class="img-responsive">
            </div>
            <p>I think about the “Express Train” solution all the time.  But I realized that’s an infrastructure issue that I cannot possibly propose as a tech solution at the hackathon.</p>
            <p>So I thought about my personal experience, particularly my own emotions on the train. MTR is hands-down one of the best subway system in the world, achieving over 80% utilization rate during peak hours but the crowd density and congestion still remains problematic, whether it’s from a CX or Operations perspective.</p>
            <div class="pfolio-img" >
                <img src="img/portfolio/hacktrain/journey-emotions.jpg" class="img-responsive">
            </div>

            
            <p>Despite the high traffic and dense crowds, there's no need to compromise great user experience while transporting people from points A to B. So, <span class="keywords">how do I enhance a commuter’s journey?</span> And that’s exactly how I crafted the story for my pitch.</p>
                    
            <h3 class="section-heading">Starting with the Morning Commute</h3>
            <p>Focusing on the morning commute peak hours, I wanted to improve the users' everyday emotions going in to work, like the hunger state for example.  I can't help users' discomfort when traveling on a packed train, but at the very least, I can help users control their journey and start their day right - <span class="keywords">ordering breakfast on-the-go.</span></p>
            <p>I proposed this as my first pitch which is how and where we form our teams of 4. I pitched the concept name as Champs because well, "Breakfast are for Champions".</p>

            <p>It sold and aligned very well with my newfound team mates and we got to hacking right away that first night.<br>
            <span class="remarks-i">(Left to right: Me, Anthony the Developer, KK the Developer, Zoe the Entrepreneur).</span></p>

            </div>
            
            <h3 class="section-heading">Breakfast Implications</h3>
            <p>It was Day 2. After Q&A and a series of Instagram-worthy photoshoots at MTR's behind-the-scenes operations center, we spent majority  of the day brainstorming, building, developing and being mentored at a co-working space.</p>

            <p>As we were hashing out our user flow, product features and business model, we realized that it relies on quite a number of dependencies - namely the tenant's operations, software and hardware integration, and each station's design and setup. We were challenged by various mentors all of which represent a different stakeholder point of view and priorities.</p>
            <p>As we tried to address all stakeholder needs, we pivoted back and forth with our ideas.  But in the end, we decided to focus on the commuters and reverted to our original idea.</p>

            <p>MTR To-Go is a mobile e-commerce platform to order your breakfast on the train and made ready for pick-up at station exits. This translates to <span class="keywords">reduced wait time, reduced congestion and a happier customer</span>.  The idea is to keep the commuters informed to make better decisions and ultimately be in control of their journey.</p>
        
            <p>In my use case, that means catching my connecting bus because I didn’t have to wait in line for my coffee.</p>

            <p>48 hours of work and less than 10 hours of sleep later, our hard work paid off. Referred to as the "eBay equivalent mobile platform", we won second place and earned ourselves a handy Samsung Tablet.</p>

            <p>I spent the next few days rejoicing my rewarding experience at this hackathon.</p>

                <p class="emphasis-i">The times I doubted our product,</p>
                <p class="emphasis-i">The times we pivoted our product  because of different stakeholders' conflict of interests,</p>

                <p class="emphasis-i">And the times of relief and happiness when they announced MTR To-Go was the 1st runner up.</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>I loved the highs and lows and and the Agile, Innovative and Collaborative environment.</p>
