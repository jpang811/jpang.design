            <h3 class="section-heading">There's more to Personalization</h3>
            <p>Now that I've mastered <a href="personalization.html" class="blurb-link">personalization</a>, I asked myself how do we get people to do what we want or at the very least influence them?</p>
            <p>Marketing has typically been more reactive and I wanted to change that.  Relying on your brand’s value proposition is not enough to keep your users engaged. The idea was to go from <i><u><b>re</b></u></i>active to <i><u><b>pro</b></u></i>active.</p>
            <p>One of the classic challenges we face at my current workplace, a loyalty program, is credit card acquisition. It’s a competitive playing field where every bank is competing for better rewards and returns, and offering different ways for users to navigate the system of reward points and to optimize credit card spending, etc.  Ultimately, the more you spend, the better. But bear in mind these “gamers” is only one part of your overall audience, whereas the rest may be more interested in the path of least resistance or whatever they come upon by chance (ie. applying at credit card booths).</p>
            <h3 class="section-heading">What's the Deal with Credit Cards?</h3>
            <p>We happened to be working on a credit card acquisition for one of our credit card partners. The challenge was part of a quarterly acquisition campaign which needed a revamp sorely.</p>
            <p>Objectively speaking, credit card campaigns get very old.  Typically, you receive either a Direct Mail or email with a cookie-cutter, standard message that says "Apply for our credit card and get offer XYZ by end of this month! Limited Time Offer!". Seriously, when is it not Limited Time Offer?</p>
            [placeholder img]
            <div>
                <div class="pfolio-img">
                    <img src="img/portfolio/engagement/ccoffer.jpg" class="img-responsive">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>I wanted to take a step back and think about what the user wants, and just for a moment, strip away all commercial opportunities we could potentially leverage on.  To begin with, we have an understanding of our members, in fact vast amounts of data in the bank on their transactions - where they travel, what they spend on, when they convert miles, etc.  So on a macro level, we roughly know what members want and that the data is reliable enough for machine learning algorithms alike to predict their likelihood to transact one way or another.</p>
                
            <p>But even so, it's a very shallow understanding. So I decided to introduce an Engagement piece, comprised of an Engagement email which lands on a Buzzfeed-inspired Engagement Survey.  The objective is very simple - you engage the member with something fun yet effortless.  By doing so, you introduce relevant, data points given by the member on a voluntary basis ie. completing the Engagement survey. </p>
             <div class="containter">
                <div class="pfolio-img">
                    <img src="img/portfolio/engagement/customer-journey.jpg" class="img-responsive">
                    <p class="remarks-i">User Journey Flow</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3 class="section-heading">Designing the Engagement</h3>
            <p>There are two challenges to this piece. First, how do I reach targeted members with this Engagement survey via email?  Second, once they land on the survey, how do I get them to complete the survey?</p>
            <p>The idea sparked when I was on Flipboard and came across this pop-up. </p>
            
            <div class="containter">
                <div class="pfolio-img">
                    <img src="img/portfolio/engagement/inspo.jpg" class="img-responsive pfolio-img">
                </div>
            </div>
            
                    
            <p>So this is what I did.</p>
            <div class="containter">
                <div class="pfolio-img">
                    <img src="img/portfolio/engagement/email.png" class="img-responsive pfolio-img">
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <p>We A/B tested the subject title and travel quotes but the concept itself was already an innovation.  Open rates skyrocketed to over 40% and click rates over 10%.</p>
            <p>Whether you agree or disagree, brace yourself for a just-for-fun engagement survey.</p>
           

            <h3 class="section-heading">So Tell Me, What's Your Travel Persona?</h3>
            <p>The trick to designing this engagement survey is it isn't just about creating a trolling or viral meme.  Sure, exposure and impression are great but it's got to have a purpose in my opinion.</p>
            <p>In addition to engagement, I wanted to collect data which corresponds to the credit card offer.  I did a quick analysis to identify its competitive advantages, which is the complimentary lounge access and welcome offer.</p>
            <p>Given that the program's strongest value proposition is travel, I crafted a 5-question survey oriented towards members' travel and lifestyle preferences.  Each question is carefully designed to identify their persona and understand their travel patterns which the credit card offer can actually answer to. Give it a shot yourself.</p>
            
            
            <iframe src="engagement/index.html" style="width: 100%; border-left: #ededed solid; height: 600px; margin-bottom: 30px; margin-top: 20px;"></iframe>
                
            
            <p>Depending on your answers of course, you get one of four personas.</p>
            <div class="containter">
                <div class="pfolio-img">
                    <img src="img/portfolio/engagement/persona.jpg" class="img-responsive pfolio-img">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>Most of us, it seems, are Adventure Seekers at heart. </p>
            <div class="containter">
                <div class="pfolio-img">
                    <img src="img/portfolio/engagement/persona-example.jpg" style="float: center" class="img-responsive pfolio-img">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p>We reached a proud 10% survey completion rate out of the 100,000+ members contacted.</p>
            <p><span class="keywords">Great things build expectations.</span> So after kicking off with a successful engagement piece, our data scientists got cracking with our survey data and personas so we can follow-up with an official acquisition email a week later.</p>
            
            
            <h3 class="section-heading">Acquisition Email</h3>
            <p>This is where the magic happens.  Each persona was already pre-assigned to a set of offers and content which resonated the most to them. For example, spontaneity, value-seeking and connectivity are important values to Adventure Seekers. So all we had to do was map each persona to the corresponding email offer.</p>
            <p>So what about those had not filled out the engagement survey aka not engaged, which message to do they get?  Based on that person’s behaviour and demographics, we clustered them and assigned them to a persona.</p>
            <p>Going along with the example of the Adventure Seeker, this was the acquisition email.</p>
            <div class="containter">
                <div class="pfolio-img">
                    <img src="img/portfolio/engagement/acq.jpg" class="img-responsive">
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>The result? A whopping 37% open and 4% click rates. </p>

            <h3 class="section-heading">What I Learned</h3>
            <p class="keywords">That engagement costs nothing.</p>
            <p>That members are engaged with the program to the extent that they are willing to take a fun quiz given no immediate incentives or offer whatsoever. But it does require <span class="keywords">follow-up.</span></p>
            <div class="containter">
                <div class="pfolio-img">
                    <img src="img/portfolio/engagement/learning.jpg" class="img-responsive pfolio-img">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p></p>
            <p>The most intriguing part of this campaign is the ability to influence members’ behaviour - the ability to convert low propensity yet highly engaged members.</p>
            <p>This is the <span class="keywords">heart of data-driven design</span> and could not have been done without either the engagement nor the quantitative propensity model. In fact, this approach maximized our reach and acquisition numbers.</p>
            <p>Now that’s what I call <span class="keywords">proactive marketing.</span></p>
