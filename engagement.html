            <h3 class="section-heading">There's more to Personalization</h3>
            <p>As with <a href="personalization.html" class="blurb-link">Part 1 of the Data-Driven UX Series on Personalization</a>, personalization is a great conversation starter but it does not promise engagement never mind conversion. I wanted to <span class="keywords">engage users and ultimately influence their behavior.</span></p>
            
            <p>One of the challenges I faced was in the competitive playing field of credit card acquisition. For some users, they are driven by facts and figures, pros and cons, whereas some are driven by emotions.  Striking that delicate balance between both groups can be challenging.</p>
            <h3 class="section-heading">What's the Deal with Credit Cards?</h3>
            <p>Credit card campaigns can get very old nowadays.  Typically, you receive either a Direct Mail or email with a cookie-cutter, standard message that says "Apply for our credit card and get offer XYZ. Limited Time Offer!". Let's be real, when is it <i>not</i> Limited Time Offer?</p>
        
            
            <div class="pfolio-img">
                    <img src="img/portfolio/engagement/ccoffer.png" class="img-responsive">
            </div>

            <p>The most logical approach was to use machine learning algorithms alike to predict users' likelihood to apply for a credit card. But even so, it's a very shallow understanding and discounts my understanding of the users' emotions and motivations. So I decided to introduce an two-part Engagement piece - an <span class="keywords">Engagement Email</span> which lands on a Buzzfeed-inspired <span class="keywords">Engagement Survey</span>. </p>
            <p>The objective is very simple - you engage the member with something fun yet effortless.  By doing so, you develop a deeper understanding of your users from both quantitative and qualitative aspects. </p>
             
            <div class="pfolio-img" style="max-width: 100%;">
                <img src="img/portfolio/engagement/customer-journey.jpg" class="img-responsive">
                <p class="remarks-i">User Journey Flow</p>
            </div>
            

            <h3 class="section-heading">Designing the Engagement</h3>
            <p>There are two challenges to this piece. First, how do I motivate users to click on the Engagement Email?  Second, once they land on the Engagement Survey, how do I get them to complete it?</p>
            <p>The idea sparked when I was on Flipboard and came across this pop-up. </p>
            
            <div class="containter">
                <div class="pfolio-img">
                    <img src="img/portfolio/engagement/inspo.jpg" class="img-responsive pfolio-img" style="max-width: 50%;">
                </div>
            </div>
            
                    
            <p>So this is what I did.</p>
            <div class="containter">
                <div class="pfolio-img">
                    <img src="img/portfolio/engagement/email.png" class="img-responsive pfolio-img">
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <p>We A/B tested the subject title and travel quotes but the concept itself was already an innovation.  Open rates skyrocketed to over 40% and click rates over 10%.</p>
            <p>Whether you agree or disagree, brace yourself for a just-for-fun Engagement Survey.</p>
           

            <h3 class="section-heading">So Tell Me, What's Your Travel Persona?</h3>
            <p>The trick to designing the survey is it isn't just about creating a trolling or viral meme.  Sure, exposure and impression are great but it's got to have a purpose in my opinion.</p>
            <p>In addition to engagement, I did a quick analysis on the offers' competitive advantages and used them as anchor points to gauge users' inclination or interest towards the offer benefits.</p>
            <p>The output was a 5-question survey on user's travel and lifestyle preferences.  Each question is carefully designed to generate a specfic persona and understand their travel patterns. Feel free to give it a shot yourself!</p>
            
            <div class="pfolio-img">
                <img src="img/portfolio/engagement/survey.jpg" class="img-responsive">
            </div>

            <p>Depending on your answers of course, you get one of four personas.</p>
            <div class="pfolio-img">
                <img src="img/portfolio/engagement/persona.jpg" class="img-responsive pfolio-img">
            </div>


            <p>Most of us, it seems, are Adventure Seekers at heart. </p>
            <div class="pfolio-img" style="max-width: 100%;">
                <img src="img/portfolio/engagement/persona-example.jpg" style="float: center" class="img-responsive pfolio-img">

            </div>
            <p>It hit a good 10% completion rate which were quite impressive given this survey had no incentives.</p>
            <p>Of course, <span class="keywords">great things build expectations.</span> So after kicking off with a successful engagement piece, my fellow data scientists got cracking with the survey data and personas so we could follow-up with an acquisition email a week later.</p>
            
            
            <h3 class="section-heading">Acquisition Email</h3>
            <p>This is where the magic happens.  Each persona was pre-assigned to a set of personalized content. For example, spontaneity, value-seeking and connectivity are important values to Adventure Seekers. So all we had to do was map each persona to the corresponding content.</p>
            <p>So what about the targeted users who had not filled out the engagement survey aka <span class="keywords">not engaged</span>, what message to do they get?  We addressed that by clustering those users by transaction behavior and demographics before assigning them to a travel persona.</p>
            
        </div>

        <div class="hero" style="padding-top: 0px;">        
            <div class="engagement-acqemail"></div>
        </div>

        <div class="container container-condensed">
            <p>The result? A whopping 35%+ open and 4% click rates. </p>

            <h3 class="section-heading">What I Learned</h3>
            <p><span class="keywords">Engagement costs nothing.</span></p>
            <p>Turns out that users are already engaged with the brand to some degree that they are willing to take a fun quiz regardless of incentives. The only expectation they have, though, is that you <span class="keywords">follow-up.</span></p>
            <div class="containter">
                <div class="pfolio-img">
                    <img src="img/portfolio/engagement/learning.jpg" class="img-responsive">
                </div>
            </div>
            <p></p>
            <p>The most intriguing part is the ability to influence members’ behaviour - the ability to convert low propensity yet highly engaged members.</p>
            <p>This is the <span class="keywords">heart of data-driven design</span> and could not have been done without either the engagement nor the quantitative propensity model. In fact, this approach maximized our reach and acquisition numbers.</p>
            <p>Now <i>that’s</i> <span class="keywords">engagement.</span></p>
