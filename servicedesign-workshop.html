           <h3 class="section-heading">Human Futures in Smart Cities</h3>
           <p>It was 2018, the third annual Service Design Hong Kong conference (now renamed <a href="https://www.re-make.asia/" class="blurb-link" target="blank">re:MAKE Asia</a>) I've been involved with. The theme was <b>Human Futures in Smart Cities</b>.</p>
           <p>As smart cities become increasingly connected and data-driven, they become more automated and involve less human interactions, which begs the question of how humans can play a role in the wake of these developments.</p>
           <p>As designers, how might we design for everyday experiences and still retain the human touch?</p>
           
            <br><br>
           <span class="section-descriptor">üôé MY ROLE</span>
           <h3 class="section-heading">Workshop facilitator</h3>
           <p>I was invited to facilitate one of the workshops for conference attendees to better understand service design, its approach and applications.</p>
           <p>I took the opportunity to turn the workshop into a game. Creating a card game from scratch, I decided to focus on one of the most important daily interactions &nbsp; - &nbsp;payment experiences.</p>

            <span class="section-description">üéÆ MY GAME DESIGN PROCESS</span>

            <h3 class="section-heading">Players, goals and rules</h3>
            <br>
            <p>With both design practitioners and non-designers attending the conference, the room had varying levels of understanding for design.</p>
            <p>For beginners, there's no use throwing them double-diamond diagrams and theories without practical applications. For designers, I wanted them to have fun instead of sit through another 'Intro to Design Thinking'.</p>
            <p>I designed for <a href="http://jpang.io/gamification.html" class="blurb-link" target="blank">gamification</a> before but game design was slightly different. The one thing they do have in common, however, is game elements.</p>
            <p><b>Players, goals and rules.</b></p>
            <p>Players are easy - the workshop attendees.</p>
            <p>The goal is to help them understand the value and applications of the design process. The outcome of each stage is to learn a new tool and for players to produce their own design artefacts.</p>
            <p>The rules are bounded by the design process. The cards are laid out in 4 separate decks by color. At different stages of the design process, the players will draw the relevant cards, which I call <b>prompts</b>.</p>
            <p>Prompts are not designed to be constraints, but rather a way to help narrow the scope and focus on the challenge at hand. The last 3 prompts are optional, so to avoid stressing workshop attendees out if they had other ideas in mind.</p>

            <p>I had a lot of fun writing this set.</p>
            <p>'Scenarios' is drawn at the start and helps set the scene.</p>
            <p>Our payment experiences are usually contextual to the places we go to. The frustrations that arise are only within that moment‚Ää&nbsp;-‚Ää&nbsp;fumbling with coins on a cab or when the machine reader doesn't recognize my Apple Pay when buying coffee.</p>
            <p>To add to the fun, I localized the scenarios specifically to the city of the conference, Hong Kong.</p>

It has a special place in the local culture but also one of the most challenging spaces in terms of digitization. Cha chan tengs are slow to adopt and still only take cash.</p>

            <p>This ideation led me to the common frustrations users face when making payments, or what I called‚Ää<b> User Resistance</b>.</p>
            <p>Using these as prompts, the workshop attendees were able to include these in their empathy map and current state journey map for the 'Scenario' they chose. </p>

            <p>If you're a designer, you know that crafting a good and succinct HMW statement is not easy. It's helpful to provide prompts to help players frame their problem statements. Not too broad, but not too specific.</p>
            <p>I looked at common payment trends that are driving the payments industry and our consumer experiences today. These became the <b>Trends</b> card.</p>

            <p>The best prompt of them all. This is the time for players to drum up their wildest ideas without constraints. I encouraged workshop attendees to stand up and role-play their possible solutions.</p>
            <p>At this stage, players can use the <b>Interactions</b> prompts to help them think outside the box.</p>
            <p>I wrote up both digital and physical interactions to push the envelope. With just paper, pen and cardboard, they can prototype the world. In fact, I once had a team prototype a VR experience by simply sticking post-its on their glasses to replicate the VR glasses.</p>

            <h3 class="section-heading">My design challenges</h3>
            <br>
            <p>My first challenge was covering everything in a 2-hour workshop. I had to pick and choose what design tools to surface without overwhelming conference attendees, especially for non-designers.</p>
            <p>For example, with little time to explain personas, I introduced the User Resistance prompts to help them quickly build a profile without developing a fully fleshed out Persona.</p>
            <p>My second challenge was designing for two different types of audiences‚Ää&nbsp;-&nbsp;‚Äädesign practitioners and non-designers. I needed to balance their needs without it being too introductory for designers and too abstract for non-designers.</p>
            <p>With a little creative writing, I was able to make the Scenarios slightly unfamiliar and challenging, but also relevant for both groups. The designers also took on the opportunity to mentor non-designers throughout the game, which was absolutely great to see.</p>
