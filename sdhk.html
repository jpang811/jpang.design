            <h3 class="section-heading">The Ride Begins</h3>
            <p>I had no idea what to expect for my first hackathon except a sleepness night and abundant adrenaline rush. I was right but it was so rewarding.</p>
            <p>The hackathon was co-hosted by Hack Partners and MTR.  The main objective was clearly laid out: to solve two main challenges: <span class="keywords">Customer Experience (CX)</span> and <span class="keywords">Operations Efficiency</span>. As daily commuters (users) of the Hong Kong railway, better known as MTR, I can relate to so many pain points but many of which I initially thought can only be solved with infrastructure.</p>

            <h3 class="section-heading">The Problem Statement</h3>
                <p>This is my current state.</p>
                <div class="containter">
                    <div class="pfolio-img">
                    <img src="img/portfolio/hacktrain/currentstate.jpg" class="img-responsive">
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>I think about the “Express Train” solution all the time.  Just like how the much-disliked subway system in New York, but you gotta love the express trains downtown, minus the surprise element where you won’t find out until it is suddenly announced on the train, which means you are likely not to hear it if you are on your earphones on the train.  But that’s an infrastructure issue that I cannot possibly propose as a tech solution at the hackathon.</p>
                <p>So I thought about my personal experience, particularly my own emotions on the train. In the context of Hong Kong’s subway system, namely MTR, achieves up to 90% utilization rate but the density and traffic are still the main problem statements, whether it’s from a CX or Operations perspective.</p>
                <div class="containter">
                    <div class="pfolio-img">

                    </div>
                </div>

            <h3 class="section-heading">Efficiency vs Optimization</h3>
            <p>MTR is hands-down, I daresay, the best subway system in the world.  It is highly efficient and reliable but the problem is it is not <i>optimized</i>. And that’s a very clear distinction.</p>
            <p>The high frequency of train answers to high traffic and dense crowds.  But the congestion from exiting platforms via escalators and stations via exits particularly during peak hours are not optimized.</p>
            [sketch?]
            <p>I decided to tackle optimization, which I like to refer as enhancement from the CX perspective. In other words, I asked myself, <span class="keywords">how do I enhance a commuter’s journey?</span> And that’s exactly how I crafted my story in my pitch.</p>
                    
            <h3 class="section-heading">#StoryofMyLife, also #Storyof<i>Your</i>Life</h3>
            <p>I’d like to enhance the post-commute part of the journey.</p>

           <p>MTR’s current state at each station</p>
           [sketch]

           <p>As an MVP, MTR To-Go is a mobile e-commerce platform to order your breakfast goods on the train and made ready for pick-up right when you exit the station. This translates to reduced wait time, reduced congestion and a happier customer.  The idea is to keep the commuters informed to <span class="keywords">make better decisions and ultimately be in control of their journey.</span></p>

           <p>In my case, that means catching my connecting bus because I didn’t have to wait in line for my breakfast.</p>



            <h3 class="section-heading">It's a Job Well Done</h3>
            <p>48 hours of work and less than 10 hours of shut eye sleep later, our hard work paid off. Referred to as the "ebay equivalent mobile platform", we scored second place and earned ourselves a handy Samsung Tablet!</p>

            <p>I spent the next few days rejoicing my rewarding experience at this hackathon.  The times we were challenged on our product and business model, the times we pivoted our product from an e-commerce platform to a centralized food pick-up pop-up to a sharing economy concept alike back to ground zero as a result of satisfying different stakeholders, the times I doubted our product and the times we needed to keep our adrenaline high at 3am in the morning.  I loved the highs and lows and discovered that I fared well in this type of environment.  Agile, Innovative and Collaborative.  </p>

            <p>I'm hooked on innovation and will be on the lookout for more.</p>
