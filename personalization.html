            <h3 class="section-heading">Derived from the Principles of Hospitality</h3>
            <p>My background and education is highly rooted in hospitality and the basics is addressing the guest by name.  But what makes personalization so special?</p>
            <p>It’s that fuzzy feeling of comfort and familiarity when the barista remembers that you like soy mocha with side of toasted, multigrain bagel and low-fat cream cheese for breakfast.</p>
            <p>Personalization comes in many forms and can be applied in so many industries as I have in my previous work experiences in retail and travel.</p>
            <p>The challenge today is that it's less commonly acknowledged never mind practiced, especially for online experiences.</p>
            
            <h3 class="section-heading">What is Personalization?</h3>
            <p>Personalization is <span class="keywords">beyond retargeting</span>.  Just because I searched for a dress on Nordstrom, then I become algorithmically qualified me for a series of repeating advertisements in hopes of conversion.  It's effective for some; but for others, it just becomes intrusive, because regardless of the retargeting, they were going to make the purchase anyway.</p>
           
            <p>I would argue that current efforts in ad retargeting is not half the story of personalization. In fact, when designing personalization, it should be part of an overall user engagement strategy rather than a mere feature.</p>
        
            <h3 class="section-heading">Building the Layers</h3>
            <div class="pfolio-img">
                <img src="img/portfolio/personalization/cake.jpg" class="img-responsive">
            </div>
            
            <h4>Basics</h4>
            <p>The bare minimum of personalization is addressing the user by name or basic demographic features. "Miss Pang, welcome back. Miss Pang, how was your trip?".  Ah, I can almost hear Siri’s warm, friendly tone.</p>
            [placeholder]<br>
            <audio controls>
                <source src="horse.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
            </audio>
            <br>
            
            <h4>Behavior-Based</h4>
            <p>Behaviour is very particular to your business and industry, and is typically measured in transactions and milestones. In the case of travel, it is mostly driven by travel frequency, destination and transactional behaviour at particular touch points of the journey. </p>
            

            <h4>Engagement-Driven</h4>
            <p>Engagement-driven are personalization features which you can introduce and store as new data points in the bank. </p>
            <p>I’ve shed some light on this in <a class="blurb-link" href="engagement.html" target="blank">Part 2 of this Data-Driven UX Design series </a> where I launched an engagement survey to discover users' travel personas.  When users engage in the survey, their answers can be used personalization features.</p>
            
            <h4>Dynamic Content</h4>
            <p>For more complex campaigns, dynamic content also serve well as personalization features which I achieve via the language, tone and aesthetics/design.</p>

            <p>Personalization is all about targeting the <span class="keywords">Right User, at the Right Time with the Right Offer.</span> The power lies in using them in the right context.</p>
            
            <h3 class="section-heading">It's Personalization Done Right</h3>
            <p>In some cases, one personalization feature may resonate more with one user than the other, at one time over another. But how is it determined?  That’s where machine learning algorithms come into play - to rank their importance and then assign these features to members respectively.</p>
            

            <p>In a travel campaign I've done in the past, I was tasked to increase conversion based on users' past travel behavior. I worked with Data Scientsts to first determine the propensity of users' likeliness to travel with us again this year and then create a few buckets of personalization features to make it relevant for each user.</p>

            <p><span class="keywords">Designing personalization features are like constructing IF statements.</span></p>
            
            <div class="hero" style="padding-top: 0px; background-color: #ededed;">        
                <img src="img/portfolio/personalization/if-logic.jpg" class="img-responsive" style="width: 80%; margin: 0 auto;">
            </div>
            <br>
                
            <p>Referring to #WhereNext, the travel campaign I previously worked on, the features were mainly based on the number of miles traveled and also served as a way to celebrate users' travel milestones.</p>
            
            <div class="pfolio-img" style="max-width: 100%;">
                <img src="img/portfolio/personalization/campaign.jpg" class="img-responsive">
            </div>
            <p>If you have flown over thousands of miles, you are likely to receive the “x miles flown with us” feature.  Alternatively, if you are a new joiner and have not accumulated enough transactions, you will likely receive the “x miles balance”.</p>
            <p>Personalization is a really nice-to-have and often times unexpected feature.  In this particular campaign, we acheived 30% open and 4% click.</p>
           

            <h3 class="section-heading">It Makes a Great Conversation</h3>
            
            <p>When designing an engagement-driven campaign like <a class="blurb-link" href="engagement.html">Part 2 of the Data-Driven UX Design series</a>, users will generate travel personas after completing an engagement survey - Captain, Chief, Executive or Adventure Seeker. Based on the personas, I use dynamic tones and design in response to their distinct characteristics.</p>
            <div class="pfolio-img">
                <img src="img/portfolio/personalization/layers.jpg" class="img-responsive">
            </div>
            
            <p class="remarks-i">Conveying assertiveness for the Captain versus playfulness for the Adventure Seeker.</p>

            <h3 class="section-heading">The Flexibility of Personalization</h3>
            <p>As you can see, personalization goes hand in hand with segmentation and there are so many ways to slice and dice them using qualitative and/or quantitative approaches.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, the challenge is providing users with the relevant context and relatable content. So yes, personalization is beyond retargeting.  <span class="keywords">It's all about crafting that multi-layered cake.</span></p>
