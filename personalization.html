            <h3 class="section-heading">Personalization is...</h3>
            <p>My background and education is highly rooted in hospitality and the basics is addressing the guest by name.  But what makes personalization so special?</p>
            <p>It’s that wow feeling you get if I remember that you love the seaview room, that you like a box of chocolate every night you come “home”, that you like a good soft pillow instead of hard one, that you love room service and your steak perfectly grilled at medium rare. </p>
            <p>In fact, personalization comes in many forms.  And the problem is that it's less commonly acknowledged never mind practiced. This is especially true for online experiences today.</p>
            <p>Personalization is <span class="keywords">beyond retargeting</span>.  For example, just because I searched for a dress on Nordstrom, then I am algorithmically qualified for a series of near-intrusive advertisements asking me over and over if I was interested in securing my final payment - <u>that's not personalization.</u> </p>
            <h3 class="section-heading">Then what is personalization?</h3>
            <p>Yes, personalization is behavior-based. And yes, retargeting is a form a personalization and is almost quite effective when it comes to an item really endearing to you and you just need that time to process to decide if you really want it.  My rule of thumb is if I really want that dress and if I keep thinking about it the next few days, then I just have to buy it (of course given that I can afford it).  So in that sense, regardless of retargeted ads, I was likely to take that action.</p>
            <p>There are many layers to it if you think about it and I like to call this The Personalization Engine.</p>

                <div class="pfolio-img">
                    <img src="img/portfolio/hacktrain/currentstate.jpg" class="img-responsive">
                </div>
            </div>
            <h3 class="section-heading">It Starts with the Basics</h3>
            <p>It goes without saying that the very minimum you should do to personalize is addressing that person by name. Miss Pang, welcome back. Miss Pang, how are you doing today?  I can almost hear Siri’s warm, friendly tone - maybe it’s the hospitality speaking.</p>
                
            

            <h3 class="section-heading">Plus Behavior-Based</h3>
            <p>Behaviour is very particular to your business and industry.  In the context of my current workplace, a loyalty program, it is mostly driven by travel, miles earning and redemption behaviour. For instance ,travel behaviour is simply where you have you traveled the past year, the number of times you’ve been back or if we know that you are a regular back to London for the sake of leisure or family.</p>
            
            <div class="containter">
                <div class="pfolio-img">
                    <img src="img/portfolio/engagement/inspo.png" class="img-responsive">
                </div>
            </div>

            <p>The power lies in using these features in the right context.  In some cases, the personalization feature resonates stronger for one member compared to others or at one time over another.  How is it determined?  That’s where our machine learning algorithms come into play - to rank their importance and then assign these features to members.</p>

            <h3 class="section-heading">And Engagement-Driven</h3>
            <p>Engagement-driven are personalization features which you introduce and are new data points in your data bank as a result. </p>
            <p>I’ve shed some light on that in another piece article but the idea is if your member or customer answers to your survey and you respond to that, that’s personalization.  In my use case of Engagement, we launched a “What Traveler Type Are You” survey which generates a travel persona for every member where I followed-up with an email and offer based on their personas.</p>

            <h3 class="section-heading">That's Personalization Done Right</h3>
            <p>Given that the Basics are already solid and established figures in the data bank, I used those as personalization features.</p>

            <p>So here’s how it works. If you traveled with us the past year, it is our window to entice you with another travel hence #WhereNext. We’d like to gently remind you of the time your Life Rewarded at a specific destination and your milestones with us.</p>

            <div class="containter">
                <div class="pfolio-img">
                    <img src="img/portfolio/engagement/email.png" class="img-responsive">
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <p>If you have flown over thousands of miles, you are likely to receive the “x miles flown with us” feature.  Alternatively, if you are new to the program and have not accumulated enough transactions, you will like lye receive the “x miles balance”.</p>
            <p>Personalization is a really nice-to-have and often times unexpected feature.  In our performance, we acheived 30% open and 4% click.</p>
           

            <h3 class="section-heading">The Complexity of Personalization</h3>
            <p>In the case of the #TraveMilestones above, it was easy because I simply used IF statements to make it dynamic content.  But what if the personalization feature was much more ingrained with content? For example:</p>
            <p>We launched an <span class="keywords">engagement survey</span> to allow members to discover their respective travel personas - Captain, Chief, Executive or Adventure Seeker.  Just from the persona names, you can already tell that each persona has distinct personalities and behavior, so that means the content you write for each persona must be dynamically written for the persona.  In fact, I had to develop multiple copies of an email just to cater to each persona.</p>
            <p>When writing to the Captain, I would use language like “We know time is of essence when it comes to traveling and we know just the right offer for you." Whereas if I was addressing an Adventure Seeker, I would say “We know you love a great adventure and looks like we have just the right offer for a #Globetrotter like yourself!”  You can see difference in tones and design which convey assertiveness for the Captain versus playfulness for the Adventure Seeker.</p>

            <div class="containter">
                <div class="pfolio-img">

                </div>
            </div>
            
            <p>Personalization goes hand in hand with segmentation/personas and there are so many ways to slice and dice them.  The most important of all is providing them with the relevant context and relatable content. </p>
        </div>
